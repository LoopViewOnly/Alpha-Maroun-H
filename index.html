      The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international
      association football competition among the senior men's national teams of
      the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association
      (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The tournament has been held
      every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, with the
      exception of 1942 and 1946 due to the Second World War. The reigning
      champions are Argentina, who won their third title at the 2022
      tournament.[1] The contest starts with the qualification phase, which
      takes place over the preceding three years to determine which teams
      qualify for the tournament phase. In the tournament phase, 32 teams
      compete for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over the course
      of about a month. The host nation(s) automatically qualify for the group
      stage of the tournament. The competition is scheduled to expand to 48
      teams, starting with the 2026 tournament. As of the 2022 FIFA World Cup,
      22 final tournaments have been held since the event's inception in 1930,
      and a total of 80 national teams have competed. The trophy has been won by
      eight national teams. Brazil, with five wins, are the only team to have
      played in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are Germany and
      Italy, with four titles each; Argentina, with three titles; France and
      inaugural winner Uruguay, each with two titles; and England and Spain,
      with one title each.

      A replacement trophy was commissioned by FIFA for the 1974 World Cup.
      Fifty-three submissions were received from sculptors in seven
      countries.[19][21] Italian artist Silvio Gazzaniga was awarded the
      commission. The trophy stands 36.5 centimetres (14.4 in) tall and is made
      of 6.175 kilograms (13.61 lb) of 18 karat (75%) gold, worth approximately
      US$161,000 in 2018. Its base is 13 centimetres (5.1 in) in diameter
      containing two layers of malachite. Chemist Sir Martyn Poliakoff claims
      that the trophy is hollow, because if it were solid gold, the trophy would
      weigh 70–80 kilograms (150–180 lb) and would be too heavy to lift;[22][23]
      the trophy's original manufacturer also confirmed its hollowness.[24][25]
      Produced by Bertoni, Milano in Paderno Dugnano, it depicts two human
      figures holding up the Earth. Gazzaniga described the trophy thus, "The
      lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to
      receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact
      body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring
      moment of victory".[19] The trophy has the engraving "FIFA World Cup" on
      its base. After the 1994 FIFA World Cup, a plate was added to the bottom
      side of the trophy where the names of winning countries are engraved,
      names therefore not visible when the trophy is standing upright. The
      original trophy is now permanently kept at the FIFA World Football Museum
      in Zurich, Switzerland. It only leaves there when it goes on its FIFA
      World Cup Trophy Tour. It is present at the Final draw for the next World
      Cup, and on the pitch at the World Cup opening game and Final.[26] The
      FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour was inaugurated for the 2006 FIFA World Cup
      competition.[27]
